<p> This is Ashley Tyau, and she is from Honolulu, Hawaii. She is a second year student studying Graphic Design. She has traveled for most of her life and has been to places like Australia, Canada, South Korea, New Zealand, Japan, and all around the U.S.. 
As a Taurus, she can be very stubborn. But when sheâ€™s not being hard-headed, she loves to make others laugh.
She plans to continue to travel when she graduates and to pursue a career that allows her to work with her photography skills. She has recently become interested in EDM music and would love to work with various music artists. A dream of hers would to be a designer for the visuals and advertising for EDC.</p>

<p1> 1.What is good screen-based design?</p1>

<p> Good screen based design is when the audience/user has an easy experience navigating the material. It is also visually appealing for on-screen experience, where the design is helping rather than distracting.</p>

<p> 2.How is art-making online different then art-making offline?</p>

<p1> Online is more technical because it can reach a broader audience within a short amount of time whereas offline art is made for the user to run into in a public setting.</p1>

<p> 3.What do you think is the purpose of the web?</p>

<p1> The purpose of the web is to share information and give access to people all over the world. The web is meant to give people access to all of the information in the world as up to date as possible. </p1>
